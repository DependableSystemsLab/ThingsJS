For now my tasks are:

	- organising the code on the dashboard into a directory structure
	
	- directory structure in MongoDB to worked on by Selina. Therefore, I need to work on the Rest API part 
	
	- the database we are using is things_dashboard db


Questions

	- what should I do the REST API for? Or just have some generic functions set up which can be later used anywhere?
