is ThingsJS?","keywords":"","body":"Background\nThe Internet of Things involves a plethora of interconnected devices that produce and consume large amounts of data. Over the last few years, the IoT landscape has grown tremendously, and applications can be found across multiple domains, both in academic and industrial circles.\nWhile traditional IoT devices consist mostly of low-level embedded sensors and actuators, a more recent generation of devices has emerged. Such devices; e.g., the popular Raspberry Pi series, are getting more and more powerful and connected, and are quickly evolving beyond their traditional role of low-level embedded sensors and actuators to become more akin to embedded computers. As such, they can execute full operating systems, such as various distributions of Linux, thereby opening the door to running complex, rich and high-level applications directly on these devices, at the edge of the network (i.e., edge computing).\nOn the other hand, to bridge the heterogeneity of the IoT landscape, there is a strong incentive for establishing common paradigms and high-level abstractions. We believe this can be done through high-level, platform-independent languages and frameworks. Not confined anymore to the realms of the web, JavaScript has grown over the last few years as a mature and dynamic language on its own. Nowadays, JavaScript applications can be found in the desktop, mobile and server spaces, and more recently, in the IoT world.\nWhat is ThingsJS?\nThingsJS is a comprehensive platform for designing and deploying high-level edge applications written in JavaScript onto the IoT devices themselves, in combination with the cloud. ThingsJS provides:\n\na set of APIs and high-level services for developers;\na set of self-adaptation features;\nrich graphical and console-based user interfaces to observe and interact with the system.\n\n"},"about/Architecture.html":{"url":"about/Architecture.html","title":"System Architecture","keywords":"","body":"System Architecture\nA ThingsJS system consists of the following:\n\nA set of Workers capable of running JavaScript Programs.\nCapability to perform platform-independent live-migration of a JavaScript Process from one Worker to another\nA Publish/Subscribe interface through which all Workers in the system communicate.\nA Scheduler service that monitors the system and coordinates the allocation and migration of Processes between the Workers.\nA Global File System accessible by all Workers.\n\nWorkers\nA ThingsJS Worker is a high-level term used to refer to an instance of CodeEngine, which implements the ThingsJS runtime system. A Worker receives control messages via the Pub/Sub interface and carries out tasks such as running or migrating a Program. Technically, it is a JavaScript daemon process running on a single machine.\nEach Worker is capable of:\n\ninstrumenting raw input code into a live-migratable version,\nrunning a Program as a child Process,\nproducing a snapshot of a running Process, and\nrestoring a Process from an input snapshot.\n\nPlatform-independent Live-migration Support\nIn order to address reliability concerns, the ThingsJS Scheduler monitors all the Devices and Processes in the network and adjusts the Schedule - i.e. assignment of Processes to Devices. In certain cases, a Process might have to be killed because of low resource or reboot after update, but an Application may require that that Process never terminate. Therefore, stateful live-migration support is critical in ThingsJS for flexible scheduling.\nIoT systems are heterogeneous and will remain thus in the future; we do not make any assumptions about the underlying hardwares in the system. However, ThingsJS does assume that each Device in the network is equipped with a JavaScript engine that implements ECMAScript 5 Standard. ThingsJS live-migration mechanism is implemented purely at the JavaScript layer through code instrumentation, and involves no modifcation to the underlying VM (i.e. JS engine).\nPublish/Subscribe Interface\nWhile the physical links between the machines will constitute some kind of a tree-like network, ThingsJS does not make any assumptions about the network layer. ThingsJS assumes that there is a Publish/Subscribe service reachable by every Worker, and all communication happens through this software-defined interface. Furthermore, ThingsJS does not assume a specific implementation of the interface, but only assumes per-topic FIFO message ordering guarantee. In the current version of ThingsJS, the Publish/Subscribe interface is centralized and uses the MQTT protocol.\nAn example of how ThingsJS uses the Pub/Sub interface:\n\nA Worker named camera-1 boots up.\ncamera-1 subscribes to topic camera-1/cmd to receive control messages.\ncamera-1 publishes its status to topic engine-registry to notify other Workers that it is online.\nThe Scheduler decides to run video-streamer.js on camera-1.\nThe Scheduler publishes a message to topic camera-1/cmd to request camera-1 to run video-streamer.js. The message contains the control keyword run along with the code of video-streamer.js.\nUpon receiving the message, camera-1 instruments the code and then executes the instrumented code as a child process.\n\nScheduler Service\nAt the bare minimum, a network of ThingsJS Workers and a Publish/Subscribe server is enough to build a working IoT system. However, with this minimal setup, coordinating the execution and migration of different Programs across the Devices is a manual effort. When there is a large number of Devices and Programs, which is a more realistic IoT setup, manual coordination becomes impractical. In its simplest form, the problem of assigning Programs to Devices boils down to the bin-packing problem. Therefore we need an automated way to manage the system.\nThingsJS assumes that there is a Scheduler Service that:\n\nhas a global view of the network,\ncan send commands to any Worker,\nmakes scheduling decisions according to some user-defined policy, and\ncan accept requests from an end-user of the system to make changes to the current Schedule\n\nWhile ThingsJS expects there to be a Scheduler, it does not assume how it is implemented. The default scheduling algorithm included in the framework is a greedy first-fit algorithm, but the user can (and should be able to) specify what algorithm the Scheduler should use. In addition, the Scheduler could be centralized or decentralized, but ThingsJS does not assume either and only expects an interface to use the service.\nGlobal File System\nAlthough it is not critical for an IoT system to have a shared file system, a lot of things become easy when it does have one. For example, creating a log for recording events across the network becomes much easier when all the Workers are writing to the same log file (or at least, the same file as far as the programmer is concerned). In addition, a Global File System is a good place to store the Application code shared by all the Workers.\nSimilar to many other concepts in ThingsJS, we do not assume a specific implementation of the file system; it could be centralized or distributed. In the current version, the file system is implemented through a central MongoDB service with a RESTful API.\nExample Setup\nA small ThingsJS system consisting of 3 different devices might look like this:\n\n1 Raspberry Pi 3 running a ThingsJS Worker runtime.\n1 Raspberry Pi Zero running a ThingsJS Worker runtime.\n1 Desktop PC, running a ThingsJS Scheduler service, a Pub/Sub server, and the File Server.\n\nA user of this system would make a request to the Scheduler service to run a Program, after which the Scheduler would decide which Raspberry Pi should run it. The Scheduler will send the Code to the target Worker via the Pub/Sub interface, and the selected Worker will execute the Program.\n"},"about/Terminology.html":{"url":"about/Terminology.html","title":"Terminology","keywords":"","body":"ThingsJS Terminology\n\nProgram: A Program is a general term used to refer to the abstract idea embedded in a single Code.\n\nCode: is the string representation of a Program.\n\nProcess: is an instance of a Program.\n\nComponent: In ThingsJS context, a Component is a Program that does one thing and is part of a larger set of Components working together as an Application.\n\nApplication: In ThingsJS context, an Application is a group of Components running on different devices, working together to provide some functionality.\n\nDevice: A device is a machine with general computational capabilities (i.e. has CPU, memory, and OS).\n\nWorker: A Worker is a high-level term for describing a single ThingsJS runtime.\n\n\n"},"api/CLI.html":{"url":"api/CLI.html","title":"CLI Commands","keywords":"","body":"CLI commands\n\nthings-js pubsub - Start a MQTT Publish/Subscribe Server\nthings-js dashboard - Start a ThingsJS Web Dashboard server\nthings-js worker - Start a ThingsJS Worker process\nthings-js instrument - Instrument a given JavaScript file to make it migratable\nthings-js restore - Restore program code from a given JSON snapshot file\nthings-js run - Run a JavaScript program as a ThingsJS process\nthings-js dispatch - Control ThingsJS workers and processes using Dispatcher commands\nthings-js scheduler - Start a ThingsJS Scheduler processs\n\n\nthings-js pubsub\n\nStart a MOSCA Publish/Subscribe Server, binding to port 1883 (MQTT).\n\nOptions:\n\n[-d | --debug] - set debug flag to true, and messages will be printed to the stdout\n\nExample:\n~$ things-js pubsub\n\nthings-js dashboard\nAlias: things-js dash\n\nThis command starts the web dashboard application, binding to port specified by port.

The distribution of these tasks on workers can be based on each component's required memory, CPU, bandwidth, etc., decided by the scheduling algorithm used.\nUser Guide\nTo run these benchmarks on a ThingsJS worker, users must have the appropriate dependencies. \n\nIn the directory the worker is to run in, make sure it has been linked to ThingsJS using the command npm link things-js. Also ensure there is a package.json folder in the directory (this may just be an empty file)\nIf using the global filesystem, ensure that all datasets have been saved on the filesystem. Otherwise, make sure all datasets are saved in the worker directory\n\nA script is provided to automatically trigger the scheduling of a benchmark (provided there exists at least one running worker and a scheduler present). The command is:\nnode benchmark.js \nGathering Measurements\nThere are two scripts that currently gather data for these benchmarks, one for resource usage, and the other for line processing rate. These scripts can be found under samples/IoTBench/scripts.\nResource Usage\nTo gather information about the resource usage for each  component in the dataflow of a benchmark, run the command: \nnode resource_measurement.js \nTry to run this script as close as possible to when the benchmark is launched to avoid capturing irrelevant data.\n\nThe data will be saved locally to a .csv file\nYou can either choose to capture CPU, memory, or both CPU and memory usage for the benchmark components \n\nLine Processing\nTo gather information about how fast each line of data is being processed in the dataflow for any of the benchmarks, run the command: node time_measurement.js before launching a benchmark. This script will capture and accumulate the time measurements for how fast each component is processing a single line from the original source data.\nTo save this information locally, run the command\nnode time_measurement.js > filepath\nThe data captured by this script is in the following format:\n   \nand also\nTotal   to indicate how long the line took to process through the entire dataflow.\nAll figures referenced from dreamlab RIOT benchmark\n"},"tutorials/":{"url":"tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","keywords":"","body":"Tutorials\n\nThe following tutorials are to demonstrate that the heterogeneous devices support the ThingJS application.\nThe live migration tutorial demonstrates how you can use the ThingsJS to migrate your applications on different devices when necessary.\nThe dashboard tutorial gives a walkthrough for using the GUI and creating your applications using ThingJS.\n\n"},"tutorials/FirstApplication.html":{"url":"tutorials/FirstApplication.html","title":"Writing your First App","keywords":"","body":"Building your first First Program using ThingsJS\nExperimental setup\nIn order to write a ThingsJS component certain things should be taken into account\nBelow we will demonstrate an application to write your first application which is a factorial application using the ThingsJS compatible rules.\nThe code for this application can be found on our Github page if you want to experiment with it.

The entire callback queue is processed every event loop iteration. If an immediate timer is queued from inside an executing callback, that timer will not be triggered until the next event loop iteration.\n\nThe usage of setImmediate shows how this code DOES NOT block the event loop, which was the entire point of writing the Factorial code in this fashion.\n\n\n"},"tutorials/Migration.html":{"url":"tutorials/Migration.html","title":"Live-Migration","keywords":"","body":"Live-migrating a JavaScript process\nThingsJS can be used to migrate a running Process from one Device to another in a stateful manner.

The working directory where the following command is entered must contain factorial.js source file.\n\n~$ things-js dispatch mqtt://192.168.0.100 run worker-A factorial.js\nthings-js dispatch is a command for performing Dispatcher operations. It will create a temporary Dispatcher object, connect to the Pub/Sub service, execute Dispatcher actions, then terminate. Supported Dispatcher actions are: run, pause, resume, kill, migrate. The signature for a things-js dispatch command is thus:\n~$ things-js dispatch   [action_args...]\nOnce the above command is successfully run, the CLI should display an output like shown in the example below:\n{ engine: 'worker-A',\n  id: 'HwJIiOTD',\n  pid: 9398,\n  status: 'Running' }\nThe id field contains the ThingsJS Process ID (not the same as PID), which we need for controlling the factorial.js process. Take note of this value. (In the example it is HwJIiOTD)\nOn Device A's console, you should also see the output from factorial.js.\n\nNext we will migrate the running factorial.js process from worker-A to worker-B. To do this, enter the following command:\n\n~$ things-js dispatch mqtt://192.168.0.100 migrate worker-A worker-B factorial.js HwJIiOTD\nThe last argument here is the ThingsJS Process ID we noted in step 6. Once the command is successful, you should see Device B continuing execution of factorial.js.\n"},"tutorials/dashboard/Dashboard.html":{"url":"tutorials/dashboard/Dashboard.html","title":"Using the Dashboard","keywords":"","body":"A Guide to Using the Dashboard\nI. Navigating the Dashboard\nThe navigation bar is located to the left of every page. Clicking on any link from the navigation bar will redirect you to a new view.\n\n\nFigure 1: Navigation bar\n\nCurrently, users can navigate to the following views:\n\nHome\nSchedule\nApplications\nFiles\n\nII. Dashboard Views\n1. Home\n\nThe Home view provides a comprehensive summary about live devices ( running code engine instances) on the network, along with the programs these devices may be executing.\n\n1.1 List of Devices\nAvailable devices can be seen from the Devices panel, along with the device's status (one of idle, busy, or dead).\n\n\nFigure 2: List of devices\n\n1.2 Device Details\nClicking on a specific device will give users the option to view details about the device on the bottom or top pane located to the right of the page.\n\n\nFigure 3: Selecting a device to view further details\n\nDetails include what programs the device is running, any device outputs to console, graphs of the device's resource usage, and general information about the device such as the device type and device id. \n\n\nFigure 4: Detailed device pane\n\n1.2.1 Running Code on a Device\nTo run code directly on a device, have the device selected in the detailed device pane. Then, select the code you want to execute on the device before clicking run. You may only select code from the \\codes directory at this time.\n\n\nFigure 5: Running code on a device\n\nOnce the code successfully launches on the device, you can  kill,  pause, or  migrate the process.\n\n\nFigure 6: Additional options for running programs\n\n2. Schedule\n\nThe Schedule view provides a time-based overview of events in the system. It also allows users to control application instances, as well as launch new ones. \nNote: This view assumes there is a running Scheduler instance on the network. Otherwise, some parts of this view will be missing.\n\n2.1 The Time-Based Events Graph\nThe graph shown on the page provides users a timeline of events that have occurred in the system. Red bars indicate when the Scheduler has been invoked. \nUsers can minimize or maximize the graph, click on a specific point in time, or navigate forwards and backwards in time.\n\n\nFigure 7: A graph of events in the system\n\n2.2 Type of Events\nThe events displayed on the graph can be further broken down into separate categories: Scheduler, Engines, and Programs. \nTo see the phases of the scheduler, select the Scheduler tab\n\n\nFigure 8a: Scheduling phases\n\nTo see device events, select the Engines tab\n\n\nFigure 8b: Device events\n\nTo see program events, select the Programs tab\n\n\nFigure 8c: Program events\n\n2.3 Application instances\nAll launched applications can be viewed on the top right of the page. Users have the option to  pause, resume, or kill these launched applications by pressing the appropriate button underneath the specific instance.\nUsers can also launch a new application by selecting a prototype that has already been created (to create a new application prototype, take a look at the Applications view).\n\n\nFigure 8d: Application instances\n\n3. Applications\n\nThe Applications view allows users to define and save their own ThingsJS applications, which can later be scheduled on available devices.\n\n3.1 Creating a New Application\nA form is provided on this page to create a new application. The steps for creating an application are as follows:\n\nProvide a name for your application\n\nBrowse through the filesystem and select components (code) to include in the application\n\n\nFigure 9: Selecting components for an application\n\n\nFor each component, specify the number of instances of that component, and the component requirements (e.g. required memory)\n\n\nFigure 10: Component requirements\n\n\nClick  when you are finished\n\n\n3.2 Existing Applications\nUsers can view existing applications on a dropdown list to the right of the page under Existing Applications. \nClicking on an application in the list will expand the panel with application details:\n\n\nFigure 11: Details for an existing application\n\n3.3 Scheduling an existing application\n\nNote: This task assumes that a running Scheduler exists on the network\n\nTo schedule an application, select an existing application and expand on its details. There will be a Schedule button. Clicking on it will send a new request to the Scheduler. \nIf an application is successfully scheduled, a notification will appear on the screen:\n\n\nFigure 12: Scheduling success\n\nIf you do not need to view the application details before scheduling, users have the option of simply selecting an existing application by name and clicking the run button to send the application request (available on the bottom right panel). From this panel, users can also control launched applications.\n\n\nFigure 13: Controlling applications\n\n4. Files\n\nThe Files view provides an interface to the ThingsJS filesystem. \n\n4.1 Filesystem Navigation\nUsers can navigate the filesystem using the Filesystem Navigator, which can be found to the right of the page. Files are indicated by a file icon, while directories are indicated by a folder icon.\n\n\nFigure 12: Filesystem navigator\n\n Clicking on a file will bring the file up on the text editor to the left of the page. Clicking on a directory will bring the user inside the folder.\n4.1.1 Current Directory\nUsers can view the current directory at the top of the page. Any files or folders created will be made to the current directory.\n\n\nFigure 13: The current directory\n\n4.2 Creating a New Directory\nTo create a new directory, type the directory name in the input field of the Filesystem Navigator. Then, click the green button beside the input field when complete.\n\n\nFigure 14: Creating a new folder\n\n4.3 Creating and Saving Files\nTo create a new file, click the Create New button located to the top-right of the page. This will clear any existing content in the text-editor. Afterwards,\n\nProvide a name for your file\n\nFill the content of your file by writing inside the text editor\n\n\nFigure 15: Writing a file\n\n\nWhen complete, click the save button located at the bottom of the page\n\n\nYour new file will be made visible in the Filesystem navigator once it has been successfully saved.\n4.4 Deleting Files and Folders\nDelete files and folders by selecting them through the Filesystem navigator. When complete, click the Delete selected button. They will disappear from the navigator once successfully deleted.\n\n\nFigure 16: Deleting files and folders\n\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"Developer API","keywords":"","body":"API Documentation for Developers\nThingsJS is a framework for running JavaScript applications on IoT devices such as Raspberry PIs\n\nNOTE: This repository is currently under active development and its contents are subject to breaking changes.\n\nDirectory Structure\n/bin\n/docs\n/lib\n    /core\n    /util\n/util\n    /dashboard\n    /gfs\n/samples\nThis repository is organized thus:\n\nbin contains the things-js CLI (shell script) that is installed with the package.

Either Mosquitto, or Mosca will do. ThingsJS provides a basic Mosca server that can be started with things-js pubsub command. The Pub/Sub service is referenced only by the URL (e.g. mqtt://localhost) within the ThingsJS framework and does not assume any specific implementation of the service.\n~$ things-js pubsub\n\nFor running the Dashboard web-application, MongoDB is required as the Dashboard uses it to store the end-user code.\n~$ service mongod start\n\n\nGetting Started\nFor trying out the framework, you can follow the steps below:\nInstallation\nOption 1\n\ngit clone this repository\n~$ git clone https://github.com/karthikp-ubc/ThingsJS.git\n\nnpm install -g to install the package. (download all the npm dependencies and link the CLI tool)\nYou may need to put sudo depending on your installation of NodeJS.\nYou need the -g (global installation) option for using the CLI.

This is because the worker needs to have a reference to the things-js module and any other npm modules that a ThingsJS user (developer) may require. If the worker cannot find a link to a node_modules directory, it will throw an error.\n~$ mkdir hello_things\n~$ cd hello_things\n~$ npm link things-js\n\n#create a config file for the worker first (e.g. node_00.conf)\n\n~/hello_things$ things-js worker node_00.conf\nThe configuration file is a required argument for starting the worker. It should contain the following information:\n{\n    \"pubsub_url\": \"mqtt://localhost\",\n    \"id\": \"node_00\",\n    \"device\": \"raspberry-pi3\"\n}\n\nTo instrument raw JavaScript code into a \"ThingJS-compatible\" code:\n\n~$ things-js inst my_code.js\n\n#OR\n\n~$ things-js instrument my_code.js\nBy default the output file will have the same file name, with the extension .things.js.\nTo specify the output file name, provide the optional argument with -o or --output.\ne.g.\n~$ things-js inst my_code.js -o my_code.instrumented.js\nLicense\nMIT\n"},"api/Devdocs.html":{"url":"api/Devdocs.html","title":"Developer Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Developer Documentation for ThingsJS\nThingsJS contains of five main capabilities.\n\nSet of workers\nPlatform-independent live Migration\nPublish-Subscribe interface, which acts as a communication channel between all the worker nodes.\nA scheduler service which schedules and manages the migration of processes between the workers.\nA global file system which is accessible by all the workers\n\nThe above five features have been have been implemented in the lib/core folder.\nThere are six main files which implement the objects of ThingsJS\nCode.js\n The Code.js file is used to instrument the code when we need to migrate the processes from one worker node to another.
