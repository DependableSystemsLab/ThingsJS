is ThingsJS?","keywords":"","body":"Background\nThe Internet of Things involves a plethora of interconnected devices that produce and consume large amounts of data. Over the last few years, the IoT landscape has grown tremendously, and applications can be found across multiple domains, both in academic and industrial circles.\nWhile traditional IoT devices consist mostly of low-level embedded sensors and actuators, a more recent generation of devices has emerged. Such devices; e.g., the popular Raspberry Pi series, are getting more and more powerful and connected, and are quickly evolving beyond their traditional role of low-level embedded sensors and actuators to become more akin to embedded computers. As such, they can execute full operating systems, such as various distributions of Linux, thereby opening the door to running complex, rich and high-level applications directly on these devices, at the edge of the network (i.e., edge computing).\nOn the other hand, to bridge the heterogeneity of the IoT landscape, there is a strong incentive for establishing common paradigms and high-level abstractions. We believe this can be done through high-level, platform-independent languages and frameworks. Not confined anymore to the realms of the web, JavaScript has grown over the last few years as a mature and dynamic language on its own. Nowadays, JavaScript applications can be found in the desktop, mobile and server spaces, and more recently, in the IoT world.\nWhat is ThingsJS?\nThingsJS is a comprehensive platform for designing and deploying high-level edge applications written in JavaScript onto the IoT devices themselves, in combination with the cloud. ThingsJS provides:\n\na set of APIs and high-level services for developers;\na set of self-adaptation features;\nrich graphical and console-based user interfaces to observe and interact with the system.\n\n"},"about/Architecture.html":{"url":"about/Architecture.html","title":"System Architecture","keywords":"","body":"System Architecture\nA ThingsJS system consists of the following:\n\nA set of Workers capable of running JavaScript Programs.\nCapability to perform platform-independent live-migration of a JavaScript Process from one Worker to another\nA Publish/Subscribe interface through which all Workers in the system communicate.\nA Scheduler service that monitors the system and coordinates the allocation and migration of Processes between the Workers.\nA Global File System accessible by all Workers.\n\nWorkers\nA ThingsJS Worker is a high-level term used to refer to an instance of CodeEngine, which implements the ThingsJS runtime system. A Worker receives control messages via the Pub/Sub interface and carries out tasks such as running or migrating a Program. Technically, it is a JavaScript daemon process running on a single machine.\nEach Worker is capable of:\n\ninstrumenting raw input code into a live-migratable version,\nrunning a Program as a child Process,\nproducing a snapshot of a running Process, and\nrestoring a Process from an input snapshot.\n\nPlatform-independent Live-migration Support\nIn order to address reliability concerns, the ThingsJS Scheduler monitors all the Devices and Processes in the network and adjusts the Schedule - i.e. assignment of Processes to Devices. In certain cases, a Process might have to be killed because of low resource or reboot after update, but an Application may require that that Process never terminate. Therefore, stateful live-migration support is critical in ThingsJS for flexible scheduling.\nIoT systems are heterogeneous and will remain thus in the future; we do not make any assumptions about the underlying hardwares in the system. However, ThingsJS does assume that each Device in the network is equipped with a JavaScript engine that implements ECMAScript 5 Standard. ThingsJS live-migration mechanism is implemented purely at the JavaScript layer through code instrumentation, and involves no modifcation to the underlying VM (i.e. JS engine).\nPublish/Subscribe Interface\nWhile the physical links between the machines will constitute some kind of a tree-like network, ThingsJS does not make any assumptions about the network layer. ThingsJS assumes that there is a Publish/Subscribe service reachable by every Worker, and all communication happens through this software-defined interface. Furthermore, ThingsJS does not assume a specific implementation of the interface, but only assumes per-topic FIFO message ordering guarantee. In the current version of ThingsJS, the Publish/Subscribe interface is centralized and uses the MQTT protocol.\nAn example of how ThingsJS uses the Pub/Sub interface:\n\nA Worker named camera-1 boots up.\ncamera-1 subscribes to topic camera-1/cmd to receive control messages.\ncamera-1 publishes its status to topic engine-registry to notify other Workers that it is online.\nThe Scheduler decides to run video-streamer.js on camera-1.\nThe Scheduler publishes a message to topic camera-1/cmd to request camera-1 to run video-streamer.js. The message contains the control keyword run along with the code of video-streamer.js.\nUpon receiving the message, camera-1 instruments the code and then executes the instrumented code as a child process.\n\nScheduler Service\nAt the bare minimum, a network of ThingsJS Workers and a Publish/Subscribe server is enough to build a working IoT system. However, with this minimal setup, coordinating the execution and migration of different Programs across the Devices is a manual effort. When there is a large number of Devices and Programs, which is a more realistic IoT setup, manual coordination becomes impractical. In its simplest form, the problem of assigning Programs to Devices boils down to the bin-packing problem. Therefore we need an automated way to manage the system.\nThingsJS assumes that there is a Scheduler Service that:\n\nhas a global view of the network,\ncan send commands to any Worker,\nmakes scheduling decisions according to some user-defined policy, and\ncan accept requests from an end-user of the system to make changes to the current Schedule\n\nWhile ThingsJS expects there to be a Scheduler, it does not assume how it is implemented. The default scheduling algorithm included in the framework is a greedy first-fit algorithm, but the user can (and should be able to) specify what algorithm the Scheduler should use. In addition, the Scheduler could be centralized or decentralized, but ThingsJS does not assume either and only expects an interface to use the service.\nGlobal File System\nAlthough it is not critical for an IoT system to have a shared file system, a lot of things become easy when it does have one. For example, creating a log for recording events across the network becomes much easier when all the Workers are writing to the same log file (or at least, the same file as far as the programmer is concerned). In addition, a Global File System is a good place to store the Application code shared by all the Workers.\nSimilar to many other concepts in ThingsJS, we do not assume a specific implementation of the file system; it could be centralized or distributed. In the current version, the file system is implemented through a central MongoDB service with a RESTful API.\nExample Setup\nA small ThingsJS system consisting of 3 different devices might look like this:\n\n1 Raspberry Pi 3 running a ThingsJS Worker runtime.\n1 Raspberry Pi Zero running a ThingsJS Worker runtime.\n1 Desktop PC, running a ThingsJS Scheduler service, a Pub/Sub server, and the File Server.\n\nA user of this system would make a request to the Scheduler service to run a Program, after which the Scheduler would decide which Raspberry Pi should run it. The Scheduler will send the Code to the target Worker via the Pub/Sub interface, and the selected Worker will execute the Program.\n"},"about/Terminology.html":{"url":"about/Terminology.html","title":"Terminology","keywords":"","body":"ThingsJS Terminology\n\nProgram: A Program is a general term used to refer to the abstract idea embedded in a single Code.\n\nCode: is the string representation of a Program.\n\nProcess: is an instance of a Program.\n\nComponent: In ThingsJS context, a Component is a Program that does one thing and is part of a larger set of Components working together as an Application.\n\nApplication: In ThingsJS context, an Application is a group of Components running on different devices, working together to provide some functionality.\n\nDevice: A device is a machine with general computational capabilities (i.e. has CPU, memory, and OS).\n\nWorker: A Worker is a high-level term for describing a single ThingsJS runtime.\n\n\n"},"api/CLI.html":{"url":"api/CLI.html","title":"CLI Commands","keywords":"","body":"CLI commands\n\nthings-js pubsub - Start a MQTT Publish/Subscribe Server\nthings-js dashboard - Start a ThingsJS Web Dashboard server\nthings-js worker - Start a ThingsJS Worker process\nthings-js instrument - Instrument a given JavaScript file to make it migratable\nthings-js restore - Restore program code from a given JSON snapshot file\nthings-js run - Run a JavaScript program as a ThingsJS process\nthings-js dispatch - Control ThingsJS workers and processes using Dispatcher commands\nthings-js scheduler - Start a ThingsJS Scheduler processs\n\n\nthings-js pubsub\n\nStart a MOSCA Publish/Subscribe Server, binding to port 1883 (MQTT).\n\nOptions:\n\n[-d | --debug] - set debug flag to true, and messages will be printed to the stdout\n\nExample:\n~$ things-js pubsub\n\nthings-js dashboard\nAlias: things-js dash\n\nThis command starts the web dashboard application, binding to port specified by port.

For example, let's say we have a simple counter program with a variable count being incremented every second. After we run this program on Device A for 10 seconds, the variable count will have a value of 10. If we then migrate this program to Device B, the program will resume from the same point, where count has the value 10. In this tutorial, we will be performing live-migration of a simple Program, factorial.js, from one Worker to another.\nSetup/Requirement\n\nAt least one machine, but preferably two machines to perform live-migration over the network\nCode for factorial.js\n\nWalk-through\nWe will refer to the two devices involved in this tutorial as Device A and B. We will assume that Device A has IP address 192.168.0.100 and Device B has IP address 192.168.0.200.\n\nFirst, we will need to set up the ThingsJS Workers. On both Device A and B, create a directory to use as the Worker's runtime environment.\n\n~$ mkdir migration-tutorial\n\nNavigate into the new directory and create the Worker configuration files (for both Device A and B).\n\n~$ cd migration-tutorial\n~/migration-tutorial$ vim my-worker.conf\n\nConfiguration file should be a JSON string with the following properties: pubsub_url, id.\n\n{\n    \"pubsub_url\": \"mqtt://192.168.0.100\",\n    \"id\": \"worker-A\"\n}\nThe value of pubsub_url should be a URL to the Publish/Subscribe service. In this tutorial, we will be hosting the Pub/Sub service on Device A, so we use the URL mqtt://192.168.0.100 - replace this with the public IP of your Device A. pubsub_url should have the same value on both Device A and B's configuration files, but id should be assigned differently.\n\nRun the Publish/Subscribe service and verify that the workers connect okay.\n\nOn Device A only:\n~$ things-js pubsub -d\nThen on both devices:\n~/migration-tutorial$ things-js worker my-worker.conf\n\nOn successful launch, you should see some messages on the console:\n\n~/migration-tutorial$ things-js worker my-worker.conf\n[Engine:worker-A] Initialized\n[Engine:worker-A] connected to Pub/Sub at mqtt://192.168.0.100\nIf there is no message about connection to Pub/Sub, it is possible that the Pub/Sub service is not running, or that the configured IP address is not reachable.\n\nWe will use the ThingsJS CLI to control the workers for this tutorial. On any machine (it does not have to be Device A or B, it just needs to be able to reach the Pub/Sub service), enter the following CLI command to run factorial.js on worker A. The working directory where the following command is entered must contain factorial.js source file.\n\n~$ things-js dispatch mqtt://192.168.0.100 run worker-A factorial.js\nthings-js dispatch is a command for performing Dispatcher operations. It will create a temporary Dispatcher object, connect to the Pub/Sub service, execute Dispatcher actions, then terminate. Supported Dispatcher actions are: run, pause, resume, kill, migrate. The signature for a things-js dispatch command is thus:\n~$ things-js dispatch   [action_args...]\nOnce the above command is successfully run, the CLI should display an output like shown in the example below:\n{ engine: 'worker-A',\n  id: 'HwJIiOTD',\n  pid: 9398,\n  status: 'Running' }\nThe id field contains the ThingsJS Process ID (not the same as PID), which we need for controlling the factorial.js process. Take note of this value. (In the example it is HwJIiOTD)\nOn Device A's console, you should also see the output from factorial.js.\n\nNext we will migrate the running factorial.js process from worker-A to worker-B. To do this, enter the following command:\n\n~$ things-js dispatch mqtt://192.168.0.100 migrate worker-A worker-B factorial.js HwJIiOTD\nThe last argument here is the ThingsJS Process ID we noted in step 6.

Schedule\n\nThe Schedule view provides a time-based overview of events in the system. \n\n2.1 The Time-Based Schedule View\nThe graph shown on the page provides users a time-based view of the events in the system. Users can minimize and maximize the graph, click on a specific point in time on the graph, or navigate forward or backwards in time. \n\n\nFigure 7: A graph of events in the system\n\n2.2 Events\nThe events displayed on the graph can be further broken down into separate categories: Scheduler, Engines, Programs. \nNote that the scheduler must be live for their events to be shown on the separate tabs. \nTo see the phases of the scheduler, select the Scheduler tab\n\n\nFigure 8a: Scheduling phases\n\nTo see device events, select the Engines tab\n\n\nFigure 8b: Device events\n\nTo see program events, select the Programs tab\n\n\nFigure 8c: Program events\n\n3. Applications\n\nThe Applications view allows users to define and save their own ThingsJS applications\n\n3.1 Creating a New Application\nA form is provided on this page to create a new application. The steps for creating an application are as follows:\n\nProvide a name for your application\n\nBrowse through the filesystem and select components (code) to include in the application\n\n\nFigure 9: Selecting components for an application\n\n\nFor each component, specify the number of instances of that component, and the component requirements (e.g. required memory)\n\n\nFigure 10: Component requirements\n\n\nClick  when you are finished\n\n\n3.2 Existing Applications\nUsers can view existing applications on a dropdown list at the bottom of the page under Existing Applications. \nClicking on an application in the list will expand the panel with information about the application\n\n\nFigure 11: Details for an existing application\n\n4. Files\n\nThe Files view provides an interface to the ThingsJS filesystem. \n\n4.1 Filesystem Navigation\nUsers can navigate the filesystem using the Filesystem Navigator, which can be found to the right of the page. Files are indicated by a file icon, while directories are indicated by a folder icon.\n\n\nFigure 12: Filesystem navigator\n\n Clicking on a file will bring the file up on the text editor to the left of the page. Clicking on a directory will bring the user inside the folder.\n4.1.1 Current Directory\nUsers can view the current directory at the top of the page. Any files or folders created will be made to the current directory.\n\n\nFigure 13: The current directory\n\n4.2 Creating a New Directory\nTo create a new directory, type the directory name in the input field of the Filesystem Navigator. Then, click the green button beside the input field when complete.\n\n\nFigure 14: Creating a new folder\n\n4.3 Creating and Saving Files\nTo create a new file, click the Create New button located to the top-right of the page. This will clear any existing content in the text-editor. Afterwards,\n\nProvide a name for your file\n\nFill the content of your file by writing inside the text editor\n\n\nFigure 15: Writing a file\n\n\nWhen complete, click the save button located at the bottom of the page\n\n\nFigure 16: Saving a file\n\n\n\nYour new file will be made visible in the Filesystem navigator once it has been successfully saved.\n4.4 Deleting Files and Folders\nDelete files and folders by selecting them through the Filesystem navigator. When complete, click the Delete selected button. They will disappear from the navigator once successfully deleted.\n\n\nFigure 17: Deleting files and folders\n\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"Developer API","keywords":"","body":"API Documentation for Developers\nThingsJS is a framework for running JavaScript applications on IoT devices such as Raspberry PIs\n\nNOTE: This repository is currently under active development and its contents are subject to breaking changes.\n\nDirectory Structure\n/bin\n/docs\n/lib\n    /core\n    /util\n/util\n    /dashboard\n    /gfs\n/samples\nThis repository is organized thus:\n\nbin contains the things-js CLI (shell script) that is installed with the package. Also contains default config files.\ndocs contains the API documentations generated by JSDoc.\nlib contains the core ThingsJS code\ncore contains the main ThingsJS objects such as Code, CodeEngine, Pubsub, Dispatcher.\nutil contains general-purpose utility modules used in the system.\nextensions contains distributed file system for the workers.\n\n\nutil contains supplementary apps and debug tools\ndashboard contains the ThingsJS Dashboard application; it is an express web-application\ngfs contains the ThingsJS distributed filesystem. The file server can be run as a standalone express web-application or as a express.Router object to be plugged into an existing application.\n\n\nsamples contains raw JavaScript sample code (non-instrumented) that can be dispatched to ThingsJS workers.\n\nDependencies\n\nThe ThingsJS framework uses MQTT Pub/Sub as its main communication mechanism and assumes the existence of an active MQTT service. Either Mosquitto, or Mosca will do. ThingsJS provides a basic Mosca server that can be started with things-js pubsub command. The Pub/Sub service is referenced only by the URL (e.g. mqtt://localhost) within the ThingsJS framework and does not assume any specific implementation of the service.\n~$ things-js pubsub\n\nFor running the Dashboard web-application, MongoDB is required as the Dashboard uses it to store the end-user code.\n~$ service mongod start\n\n\nGetting Started\nFor trying out the framework, you can follow the steps below:\nInstallation\nOption 1\n\ngit clone this repository\n~$ git clone https://github.com/karthikp-ubc/ThingsJS.git\n\nnpm install -g to install the package. (download all the npm dependencies and link the CLI tool)\nYou may need to put sudo depending on your installation of NodeJS.\nYou need the -g (global installation) option for using the CLI. If you don't plan on using the CLI, you can omit the -g option.\n~$ cd ThingsJS\n~/ThingsJS$ npm install -g\n\n\nOption 2\n\nInstall via npm~$ sudo npm install -g things-js\nYou may omit the sudo depending on your NodeJS install settings.\n\nUsing the CLI\nAlong with the API provided, CLI is included for easy use.\nCommands available currently:\n\nthings-js dashboard\nthings-js worker {config}\nthings-js instrument {code}\n\n\nTo start the Dashboard Application:\n\n~$ things-js dash\n\n#OR\n\n~$ things-js dashboard\nBy default it connects to MQTT at localhost:1883, MongoDB at localhost:27017/things_dashboard, and listens on localhost:3000.\nTo start the dashboard with a different configuration, you can use the -c or --config options with the config file path provided as an argument.\ne.g.\n~$ things-js dash -c my_config.conf\nThis will start a web-application served at the specified port.\nYou can watch the demo of the Dashboard here:\nClick Image to see Demo Video\n\nRunning a ThingsJS worker:\n\nTo start a ThingsJS worker, first you need to create a directory that will provide the NodeJS environment. This is because the worker needs to have a reference to the things-js module and any other npm modules that a ThingsJS user (developer) may require. If the worker cannot find a link to a node_modules directory, it will throw an error.\n~$ mkdir hello_things\n~$ cd hello_things\n~$ npm link things-js\n\n#create a config file for the worker first (e.g. node_00.conf)\n\n~/hello_things$ things-js worker node_00.conf\nThe configuration file is a required argument for starting the worker. It should contain the following information:\n{\n    \"pubsub_url\": \"mqtt://localhost\",\n    \"id\": \"node_00\",\n    \"device\": \"raspberry-pi3\"\n}\n\nTo instrument raw JavaScript code into a \"ThingJS-compatible\" code:\n\n~$ things-js inst my_code.js\n\n#OR\n\n~$ things-js instrument my_code.js\nBy default the output file will have the same file name, with the extension .things.js.\nTo specify the output file name, provide the optional argument with -o or --output.\ne.g.\n~$ things-js inst my_code.js -o my_code.instrumented.js\nLicense\nMIT\n"},"api/Testing.html":{"url":"api/Testing.html","title":"Running Unit Tests","keywords":"","body":"Running Tests\nThe library includes a set of unit tests, as
